# CompostConnect
Our project seeks to reduce food waste in Chicago by connecting restaurants/cafes that produce food waste with urban farms, community gardens, and co-ops able to accept compostable material. Locations with composting programs can use our site to post their information to our map. Individuals and businesses can view locations near them, and access contact information to get details on the composting program and drop-off.

## Instructions
Compost Connect can be used to browse for sites in the Chicagoland region that take compostable materials. If you'd like to add your own site to the map, use the form in the "Add a Site" tab. After adding your site, you will be able to see it on the map immediately in the "Find a Site" tab. When browsing for sites, click each icon to find out more information on the site and obtain their contact information. Interest in composting or learning more? Click the "Learn" tab to find out more!
